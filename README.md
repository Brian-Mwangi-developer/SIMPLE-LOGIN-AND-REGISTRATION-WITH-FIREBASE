# SIMPLE-LOGIN-AND-REGISTRATION-WITH-FIREBASE
tried creating a simple login and registration webpage where it is connected to firebase
Ensure you setup your email to firebase(it is a database that store all the users info eg: email and password used to register) by signing up .
if using visual studio code ensure you have a live server extension on. if not:
  a) open the extension page on visual studio code and search for live server and enable and you are good to go.
  # the problem that occurs if the live server is not available, is that the webbrowser may deny permission to make the button redirect to the other page(eg registration to login).
